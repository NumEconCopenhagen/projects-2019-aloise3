# Dataproject

In this project I have gathered data from Penn World Tables, World Governance Indicators and Barro-Lee to gather measures of investment rates, human capital and proxies for government effectiveness. The objective is to determine government measures' effect on determinants of growth. I reshape the data to a wide format, exclude outliers and clean empty variables in order to better visualize the data. I present the data in easily readable distribution plots and estimate the effect using OLS.
