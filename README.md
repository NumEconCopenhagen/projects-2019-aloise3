A short description of the files and folders:

* [/dataproject](/dataproject): The dataproject goes over the effect that education and strong infrastructure has on a countrys growth rate. Examining a combined dataset from worldbank and Barro and Lee I find that there is indeed a connection between growth and institutional factors. 
* [/examproject](/examproject): The examproject consists of solutions to three problems. An intertemporal consumption problem, a solution and simulation of the AS-AD model, and solving for equilibriums in an exchange economy.
* [/modelproject](/modelproject): The modelproject goes through the basic solow model and extends onto a solow model with technological advances.
