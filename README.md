# Welcome to your NumEconCPH repository

We have provided you with the following repository that contains the required structure for this course. **You should not change any folders in the root directory**.

A short description of the files and folders:

(https://www.github.com/numeconcopenhagen/numeconcopenhagen-2018/blob/master/README.md).
* [/binder](/binder/): The folder is used by mybinder.org to setup an interactive version of the repository. For details see this [guide](https://numeconcopenhagen.netlify.com/guides/mybinder/).
* [/dataproject](/dataproject): The dataproject goes over the effect that education and strong infrastructure has on a countrys growth rate. Examining a combined dataset from worldbank and Barro and Lee I find that there is indeed a connection between growth and institutional factors. 
* [/examproject](/examproject): The examproject consists of solutions to three problems. An intertemporal consumption problem, a solution and simulation of the AS-AD model, and solving for equilibriums in an exchange economy.
* [/modelproject](/modelproject): The modelproject goes through the basic solow model and extends onto a solow model with technological advances. 
* [.gitignore](/.gitignore): A textfile specifying files and folder that will not be uploaded to github, and will not be tracked by git.
