# Examproject

Required packages
Numpy, Sympy, Scipy, matplotlib

The examproject consists of 3 tasks.

1. Solving a human capital accumulation problem over two periods. Displaying if a worker will work or not in each of the periods. I maximise constrained utilities and illustrate how human capital affects willingness to work/to not work.

2. The AS-AD model. I solve for the equilibrium values of output and inflation, then simulate the relationships with different processes and present the results. There was some trouble in the last question due to quite a few errors. 

3. The exchange economy. I solve an exchange economy with initial endowments and plot the distribution of the utility functions. I had trouble with presenting the excess demand, so there is no working code for that problem.
